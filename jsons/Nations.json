As your people faced possible starvation, you kept a steady hand and a cool head when negotiating for better terms of peace, for fair deals, and for aid. When some of your people attacked the Canadians, you chose prison over war, laying down your life to prevent the Canadians from branding the Cree as enemies - even though you were innocent of any wrong doing. Your wise actions and good counsel saved your people both from starvation adn war with Canada, but at great cost.",

into which, when it was completed, he withdrew, vanishing suddenly from the eyes of the Thracians, who greatly regretted his loss, and

of the Greeks. I for my part neither put entire faith in this story of Zalmoxis and his underground chamber, nor do I altogether discredit it: but I believe
